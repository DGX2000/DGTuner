# DGTuner

An instrument tuner with a simple interface made with SFML. test

# Installation

## Preparation

The only required library for compilation is SFML 2.5.1 ("Simple and Fast Multimedia Library"). Head to SFML's [download](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php) page or - if you're on Linux - install it with your package manager.
As an example for the Aptitude package manager (Debian), use:

```
sudo apt install libsfml-dev
```

## Compilation

CMake is used as build system. On Linux the program can be built and compiled in the following way:

```
mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..

make
```

## Installation

# Documentation

The documentation can be generated with [doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html). At minimum the version 1.9.1 of doxygen is needed, if this prerequisite is fulfilled, the documentation can be generated by executing

```
make doc
```

in the build directory that was previously prepared in the compilation step.
